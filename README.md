# Streamlit Air Quality Prediction (ML)

This project predicts future CO2 levels using a machine learning approach. I utilize data from 2014-2018 and aim to forecast CO2 levels for the next 30 years. The prediction models used include Single Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA. 

After evaluation, Double Exponential Smoothing was found to be the most suitable for this dataset.
